      It should be understood at the outset that, although exemplary embodiments are
      illustrated in the figures and described below, the principles of the present
      disclosure may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently
      known or not. The present disclosure should in no way be limited to the exemplary
      implementations and techniques illustrated in the drawings and described below.
      Additionally, unless otherwise specifically noted, articles depicted in the
      drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale.<br />(7) Laser detection and ranging
      (LADAR) systems are the optical analog of radar systems, in which the target
      is illuminated with light from a laser source and the return is detected with
      an optical detector. The resulting signal from the optical detector is processed
      to determine information about the target, such as range or velocity.<br />(8)
      LADAR applications are driven to some extent by component technologies. Laser
      sources include both diode lasers that are generally compact, efficient, and
      low-cost but only low power, and eye-safe lasers that operate at wavelengths
      greater than about 1.5 microns (\u03BCm) and enable long-range, free-space LADAR.
      Detectors are often array detectors, to reduce the requirement for beam scanning.
      Processors, because processing of LADAR data can be computationally intensive,
      must typically enable high-speed\u2014and often real-time\u2014LADAR imaging.<br
      />(9) Two-dimensional arrays of coherent detectors are required for many advanced
      coherent laser detection and ranging (LADAR) systems. A conventional approach
      is to use an array of discrete high-bandwidth detectors each having an amplifier,
      analog-to-digital (A/D) converter and memory. The resulting large volume of
      data is then sent to a processor to compute the amplitude and phase of the return
      signal. The high digitization rates and large volumes of resulting data have
      limited array sizes to a small number of pixels (on the order of 10s of pixels).
      There is also typically a large time interval required to process the data so
      that real-time operation is not achieved.<br />(10) LADAR systems may generally
      be grouped into three main categories: pulsed LADAR, in which the illuminating
      laser is pulsed and the detector records time-of-flight; amplitude modulated
      (AM) LADAR, in which the amplitude of the illuminating beam is sinusoidally
      modulated and the detector records phase of return amplitude modulation; and
      frequency modulated (FM) LADAR, in which the frequency and/or phase of the laser
      illumination is modulated, and the detector records the relative optical phase
      of the return signal. (Additionally, some LADAR systems use the parallax effect,
      which is not considered in this disclosure.) All three categories of LADAR systems
      are used in various application-dependent environments, typically with use of
      pulsed LADAR for long range mapping, AM modulated LADAR for short range three
      dimensional (3D) imaging, and FM modulated LADAR for interferometry, frequency
      domain optical coherence tomography, and synthetic aperture imaging.<br />(11)
      <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 1A</figref> diagrammatically illustrates
      operation of a pulsed LADAR system <b>100</b> typically employed for long-range
      3D imaging. A laser source <b>101</b> emits pulsed light <b>102</b> illuminating
      a distant target <b>103</b>. The laser <b>101</b> is ideally an eye-safe, high
      pulse repetition frequency (PRF) emitting pulses on the order of 1 nanosecond
      (ns) duration, and high pulse energy device enabling long range, large field-of-view
      operation by the system <b>100</b>. A return part <b>104</b> of the light <b>102</b>
      reflecting off the target <b>103</b> and reaching an imaging telescope <b>105</b>
      is focused by the imaging telescope <b>105</b> onto a two dimensional (2D) detector
      array <b>106</b> comprising M\xD7N pixels. The detector array <b>106</b> records
      return time (time-of-flight) on a per-pixel basis, with the output of the detector
      array <b>106</b> processed by a processor (not shown separately in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
      1A</figref>) capable of handling high data and throughput rates to determine
      relative timing of return signals at different pixels and produce a 3D image.
      Implementing a detector array with sufficient timing resolution is a challenging
      design issue for this type of system. The detector array <b>106</b> should preferably
      comprise detector pixels that incorporate high-speed detection and local processing,
      to achieve fine timing-resolution detection and reduce the volume of data sent
      from the detector array to the processor. Some imaging detector arrays convert
      optical intensity into a serialized (raster scanned) analog signal, with an
      analog-to-digital (A/D) converter with memory (e.g., a frame-grabber) used to
      capture the data before transferring the data to a processor. 2D detectors generally
      incorporate digital processing into each pixel and the associated detector readout
      circuit, which is enabled by modern, fine-detail integrated circuit fabrication
      processes and which forms a digital readout integrated circuit (ROIC). Applications
      of digital ROIC technology are especially useful for improving data quality
      or reducing the volume of data. Advanced infrared (IR) detectors use digital
      ROICs with A/D conversion incorporated into the pixels to enhance dynamic range.
      LADAR systems use digital ROICs for fine resolution timing of return signals,
      to determine the temporal location of peak return rather than digitizing the
      entire temporal signal.<br />(12) Another aspect of pulsed LADAR systems is
      that for long-range operation, high-sensitivity detector elements such as avalanche
      photo diodes (APDs) are required. In this regime, the photonic nature of the
      light must be considered, such that APDs are adjusted to operate in high-gain,
      Geiger-mode (GmAPDs). The analog signal from a GmAPD is series of temporal pulses
      caused by one or more of: photo-events from the return signal (shot-noise);
      spontaneous photo-events from dark noise (dark counts); photo-events from background
      light (background counts); and photo-events triggered by other events (ghosts).
      There can also be intra-pixel cross talk within an array of GmAPDs. Nonetheless,
      an array of GmAPDs with a digital ROIC is naturally well-suited for pulsed LADAR,
      since a GmAPD array records only time-stamps corresponding to sparse photo-events
      rather than digitizing temporal intensity signal and high PRF lasers allow averaging
      over multiple pulses to reduce impact of noise. In the photon-limited regime,
      the photo-sensitive detector is typically a GmAPD array with an ROIC that records
      arrival times for photo-events.<br />(13) <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
      1B</figref> diagrammatically illustrates operation of an AM LADAR system <b>110</b>
      typically used for shorter range applications. The laser source <b>111</b> in
      this implementation provides AM modulated light <b>112</b>. The relative phase
      of the return signal <b>114</b> focused by imaging telescope <b>115</b> on detector
      array <b>116</b> provides a relative 3D range over the target <b>113</b>. A
      typical modulation frequency for the light <b>112</b> is on the order of 10s
      of mega-Hertz (MHz)(e.g., 30 MHz, which results in an ambiguity interval of
      5 meters). AM LADAR systems are often configured as a scanning system, but more
      recent implementations use a detector array. For detector arrays, every pixel
      should be capable of independently determining the distance to the object based
      on light received at that pixel, in effect operating as a massively parallel
      laser illuminated detection and ranging (LIDAR) on a single integrated circuit.
      Each pixel should allow accurate measurement of the arrival time of the collected
      photons in order to be substantially immune to detector array surface defects
      that might otherwise adversely affect time of flight ranging. Single photon
      avalanche diode (SPAD) based GmAPD pixels in the detector array enable such
      accurate measurement. SPAD devices detect the incoming sinusoidally modulated
      light intensity as series of photo-events using a high speed clock cycled through
      four states (quadrature detection). Photo-events that occur during these separate
      clock states are accumulated for use in a detection process that utilizes a
      synchronous clock to determine a phase of the return signal based on the accumulated
      photo-events corresponding to the four clock states. The gaming and machine
      vision industries in particular have driven development of sophisticated AM
      LADAR detectors with photon-counting based synchronous detection, measurement
      of modulation quadrature values performed at the pixel level, and fabrication
      based on low cost complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes.<br
      />(14) <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 1C</figref> diagrammatically illustrates
      operation of an FM LADAR system <b>120</b> based on frequency modulation of
      a coherent laser source. The laser source in this implementation includes a
      master oscillator (MO) <b>121</b><i>a</i>, a frequency modulator (FM) <b>121</b><i>b</i>,
      and an amplifier (AMP) <b>121</b><i>c </i>producing the output <b>122</b> illuminating
      the target <b>123</b>, and a second frequency modulator <b>121</b><i>d </i>receiving
      a signal from the master oscillator <b>121</b><i>a </i>together with a local
      oscillator (LO) <b>121</b><i>e </i>producing an output <b>127</b> illuminating
      the detector array <b>126</b>. The target <b>123</b> is illuminated with coherent
      light <b>122</b> that originates from the master oscillator <b>121</b><i>a </i>and
      passes through the frequency modulator <b>121</b><i>b </i>and amplifier <b>121</b><i>c</i>.
      The return light <b>124</b> focused on the detector array <b>126</b> by the
      imaging telescope <b>125</b> interferes with light <b>127</b> from the local
      oscillator <b>121</b><i>e</i>, a frequency modulated beam derived from the master
      oscillator <b>121</b><i>a</i>. The amplitude and phase of the return signal
      <b>124</b> provide information about the target <b>123</b>. The detector pixels
      detect a sinusoidally modulated interference signal\u2014that is, the signal
      incident on the pixels results from coherent interference of the return beam
      <b>124</b> and the local oscillator beam <b>127</b>. For the simple case of
      a frequency offset between the return and local oscillator beams, the resulting
      signal intensity detected by the pixels is:<br />(15) <maths id=\\\"MATH-US-00001\\\"

      and depicted in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 2</figref>, then process

      3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating synchronous coherent optical detection
      for FM LADAR in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. The optical
      detector <b>300</b> is employed as the detector array <b>126</b> in the system
      depicted in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 1C</figref>. The optical detector
      <b>300</b> is formed by a two-dimensional M\xD7N array of pixels. The optical
      detector <b>300</b> is a large format array having more than on the order of
      ten pixels in each direction and preferably having on the order of hundreds
      of pixels or more in each direction (e.g., a 512\xD7512 or larger array). Each
      pixel within the optical detector <b>300</b> has a photosensitive material <b>301</b>
      receiving the sinusoidal return comprising return light and coherently interfering
      local oscillator light as described above in connection with <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIGS.
      1C and 2</figref>. The photosensitive material <b>301</b> for each pixel produces
      an analog output <b>303</b> received by a local processing circuit <b>304</b>
      for the respective pixel. Each local processing circuit <b>304</b> receives
      a local clock signal <b>305</b> and outputs four quadrature value signals <b>306</b>
      representing sampling of the analog output <b>303</b> at intervals during a
      single sample period. The local clock signal <b>305</b> is received from, and
      the quadrature signals <b>306</b> are provided to, a data bus <b>307</b> that
      operates under the control of one or more timing/control signals <b>308</b>
      and that outputs serialized digital representations of the quadrature signals
      <b>306</b> on a signal line <b>309</b> to a processor or computer <b>310</b>.
      Processor/computer <b>310</b> (or at least portions thereof) may be formed on
      the same integrated circuit chip and/or packaged within the same integrated
      circuit package as the remainder of optical detector <b>300</b>. Within the
      processor/computer <b>310</b>, each of the quadrature signals is separately
      processed in the manner described above in connection with <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIGS.
      2 and 2A</figref>. The detector <b>300</b> thus applies ROIC technology to coherent
      detection, computing quadrature components Q.sub.0, Q.sub.1, Q.sub.2, Q.sub.3
      of a single interfering frequency (IF) component or optionally a small number
      of IF components. The quadrature components\u2014and therefore the amplitude
      and phase\u2014of the IF are computed at the sensor frame rate, allowing detection
      to be performed on a large format 2D detector.<br />(19) It should be noted
      that, although quadrature components are described in the exemplary embodiment
      above, the number of samples captured during a clock sample period may be less
      (e.g., three) or more (e.g., five or greater) than four. The number of parallel
      signal lines <b>306</b> from the local processing circuit <b>304</b> for each
      pixel and the data bus <b>307</b> would naturally match the number of samples
      captured at intervals during a single sample period.<br />(20) Applications
      of synchronous coherent optical detection for FM LADAR include real-time interferometry,
      velocity measurement, vibration sensing, two-wavelength 3D imaging, and wavefront
      sensing for atmospheric compensation. Synchronous coherent optical detection
      for FM LADAR enables 3D imaging at much longer ranges than AM systems, and is
      applicable to the gaming industry and virtual reality systems.<br />(21) <figref
      idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates use of synchronous coherent
      optical detection for FM LADAR for real-time interferometry in accordance with
      embodiments of the present disclosure. For real-time interferometry, the phase
      data from coherent synchronous detection is equivalent to an interferogram,
      and quadrature detection is equivalent to phase-shifting interferometry. In
      the real-time interferometry system <b>400</b>, an FM laser source <b>401</b>
      emits illumination <b>402</b> that is split by a beam splitter <b>403</b> such
      that a portion is received by a frequency modulator <b>404</b>, which produces
      frequency modulated illumination <b>405</b> based on the emitted light <b>402</b>.
      A remainder of the emitted light <b>402</b> passes through a lens <b>406</b>
      onto a half-silvered mirror <b>407</b> that reflects part of the light onto
      a test surface <b>408</b>. Portions of the light reflecting off test surface
      <b>408</b> passes through mirror <b>407</b> and through lens <b>409</b> to impinge
      upon an optical detector <b>410</b> structured as depicted in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
      3</figref>. The reference light <b>405</b> passes through a lens <b>411</b>
      and reflects off half-silvered mirror <b>407</b>, and then also passes through
      lens <b>409</b> to impinge upon the optical detector <b>410</b>. In this implementation,
      the light reflected off test surface <b>408</b> and passing through mirror <b>407</b>
      to reach the optical detector <b>410</b> corresponds to the return light <b>124</b>
      reflected off the target <b>123</b> in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 1C</figref>,
      while the reference light <b>405</b> reflected off the mirror <b>407</b> to
      reach the optical detector <b>410</b> corresponds to the local oscillator light
      <b>127</b>. In this application, the high frame-rate capability of the optical
      detector <b>410</b> allows analysis of components in dynamic conditions. The
      phase difference between interferograms at different times allows determination
      of displacement, and therefore velocity measurement (since displacement per
      unit time is velocity), and measurement of velocity periodicity allows determination
      of vibration. The difference between phase measurements at two wavelengths (which
      may be recorded sequentially or, for an advanced synchronous detector, on two
      interference frequencies) provides 3D imaging.<br />(22) For turbulence compensation,
      coherent synchronous detection also allows real-time recording of complex-values
      images, to which a sharpness algorithm may be used to determine atmospheric
      phase error to produce a turbulence-corrected image or to determine the correction
      to be applied to pre-compensate a high-energy laser. Additional details of turbulence
      correction may be found in J. C. Marron, et al., \u201CAtmospheric turbulence
      correction using digital holographic detection: experimental results,\u201D
      <i>Optics Express, </i>17, 11638-11651 (2009).<br />(23) For digital holography,
      conventional detector arrays employ long pulse illumination with zero interference
      frequency. The static fringe pattern recorded represents coherent information
      recorded on a spatial carrier frequency. Synchronous coherent detection can
      operate at Q=1 rather than Q=2.<br />(24) Modifications, additions, or omissions
      may be made to the systems, apparatuses, and methods described herein without
      departing from the scope of the disclosure. For example, the components of the
      systems and apparatuses may be integrated or separated. Moreover, the operations

      disclosure is directed in general to laser detection and ranging, and, more
      particularly, to frequency-modulated laser detection and ranging.<br />BACKGROUND
      OF THE DISCLOSURE<br />(2) Current approaches for obtaining the largest format
      detector arrays for frequency-modulated laser detection and ranging have involved
      increasing the number, size and/or complexity of amplifiers, analog-to-digital
      converters, and memories associated with the pixels of an array of high-bandwidth
      detectors. High digitization rates and the resulting large volumes of data that
      must be sent to a processor to compute the amplitude and phase of the return
      signal have limited array sizes and effectively precluded real-time operation.<br
      />(3) There is, therefore, a need in the art for improved capture and handling
      of data employed for coherent laser detection and ranging.<br />SUMMARY OF THE
      DISCLOSURE<br />(4) A frequency modulated (coherent) laser detection and ranging
      system includes a read-out integrated circuit formed with a two-dimensional
      array of detector elements each including a photosensitive region receiving
      both return light reflected from a target and light from a local oscillator,
      and local processing circuitry sampling the output of the photosensitive region
      four times during each sample period clock cycle to obtain quadrature components.
      A data bus coupled to one or more outputs of each of the detector elements receives
      the quadrature components from each of the detector elements for each sample
      period and serializes the received quadrature components. A processor coupled
      to the data bus receives the serialized quadrature components and determines
      an amplitude and a phase for at least one interfering frequency corresponding
      to interference between the return light and the local oscillator light using
      the quadrature components.<br />(5) Although specific advantages have been enumerated
      above, various embodiments may include some, none, or all of the enumerated

      a front and rear three-point hitch as they are combined with a tractor <b>38</b>
      in the prior art. This side view shows a Carry-All implement <b>300</b> mounted
      to the front and rear three-point hitches of a tractor <b>38</b>. Shown are
      the three points of attachment of a three-point hitch to the Carry-All implement
      <b>300</b> using two bottom-link attachment arms <b>318</b> and a top-link attachment
      arm <b>324</b>. Two bottom link attachment arms <b>318</b> (see <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.

      application of use requires otherwise. Lift link arms <b>330</b> are visible
      on the front three-point hitch while not being visible on the rear three-point
      hitch being hidden by the larger rear tires. In many farming and excavating
      instances a rear three-point hitch is used by itself without a front three-point
      hitch being attached to the tractor <b>38</b>. Using a combined front and rear
      three-point hitch can increase the efficiency of the farming or excavation application
      if used properly.<br />[0298] <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 1<i>b </i></figref>shows

      the first connecting apparatus <b>40</b> at front and rear locations. The connection
      apparatus <b>40</b> mounts first to the three-point hitch of the tractor and

      2</figref> shows the prior art implement <b>300</b>, that includes a top attachment
      receiver <b>312</b> which usually comprises a pair of spaced apart aligned projections
      or flanges centrally disposed and having a hole there through for receiving
      a distal end <b>326</b> of the top-link arm <b>324</b> which is releasably held
      thereto by a pin or bolt <b>310</b>. The distal end <b>326</b> can comprise
      a socket. The opposing end <b>322</b> of the top-link arm <b>324</b> also comprises
      a distal ball socket for attachment to the tractor top-link attachment location
      with similar spaced apart projections and retaining pin or bolt. The implement
      <b>300</b> typically includes a transversely extending tool bar or frame member
      having laterally spaced apart studs <b>314</b> extending from the tractor-facing
      side of the implement frame for removable attachment to the bottom-link arm
      <b>320</b> sockets held within the distal ends of the bottom-link arms <b>318</b>.
      In the alternative, laterally spaced apart studs <b>314</b> are replaced with
      two flanges with axial centered holes <b>195</b> (see <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
      24</figref>) with a pin therein for connection to the bottom-link arms <b>318</b>.
      The distal end <b>326</b> of the top-link arm <b>324</b> and distal ends <b>320</b>
      of the two bottom-link arms <b>318</b> contain within sockets having rotatable
      balls including apertures extending there-through for insertion of pins for
      connecting these three ends to fixed points on the implement. The top-link arm
      <b>324</b> includes a turn-buckle assembly with threaded rods and a threaded
      hollow cylinder which can be rotated to lengthen or shorten the overall length
      of the top-link arm <b>324</b>.<br />[0301] <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIGS.
      3</figref> shows prior art lift-link arms <b>330</b> connect at lift-link arms
      connection to bottom-link arms <b>332</b> that cause the bottom-link arms <b>318</b>
      to rotate upward and downward pivoting the proximate ends of the bottom-link
      arms on a spindle and raising the distal end of the bottom-link arms <b>320</b>
      and the implement attached thereto. The top-link arm <b>324</b>, in turn, causes
      the upright portion of the carry-all implement <b>300</b> to maintain general
      uprightness or verticality. Consequently, the horizontal portion of the implement
      remains generally horizontal throughout the upward and downward motion of the
      carry-all implement <b>300</b> (see <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 2</figref>).
      Because the bottom-link arms <b>318</b> points of attachment to the tractor
      under-carriage location <b>316</b> are also ball and socket arrangements, the
      implement is free to move laterally a fixed distance providing \u201Cplay\u201D
      for with respect to the tractor. In some situations, this freedom of movement
      is desirable, and in other situations, undesirable. As in the case of this present
      invention, the freedom of movement situation is undesirable, additional stabilizer
      arms are connected, one to each of the bottom-link arms. One end of the stabilizer
      arms connected approximately half way down the length of each bottom-link arm
      <b>338</b>, the other end is connected to a fixed point on the tractor under-carriage
      location <b>334</b> which is coaxial with the two bottom-link arm connections
      to the tractor under carriage at location <b>316</b>. This allows full up and
      down movement of the implement but removes any random lateral motion of the
      implement. The stabilizer arms <b>336</b> may be a turn-buckle assembly with
      threaded rods and a threaded hollow cylinder which can be rotated to lengthen
      or shorten the overall length of the stabilizer arm. In the alternative, the
      stabilizer arms may be a rigid arm with an adjustable threaded screw device
      located at the bottom-link arm location <b>338</b>. Another alternative to the
      above stated stabilizer arms is one or two stabilizer arms connected to a rigid
      point on the tractor and the other end connected crossways to one or both of
      the bottom-link connection pins <b>314</b> (see <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
      2</figref>) to the implement.<br />[0302] Bottom-link arms <b>318</b> support
      the weight of the implement. Lift-link arms <b>330</b> attach between the bottom-link
      arms <b>318</b> and tractor hydraulic actuated lift arms at connection point
      <b>328</b>. The adjustable top-link arm <b>324</b> attaches to the tractor mounted
      top-link bracket <b>340</b> with a removable pin or bolt thru the top-link arm
      distal end <b>322</b>, which can have a mounted rotatable ball, while the opposed
      distal end <b>326</b> of the top-link arm has a rotatable ball and attaches
      to a top-link attachment plate <b>312</b> on the implement as shown in <figref
      idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 2</figref>. A Power Take-Off shaft (PTO) (not shown)
      can be disposed centered on the rear of the tractor through the PTO pathway
      <b>98</b> in a plane between the height of the top-link attachment plates <b>340</b>
      on the tractor and the bottom-link attachments <b>316</b> to the tractor.<br
      />[0303] <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
      6</figref> show the tractor-facing side of the laterally adjustable three-point
      hitch implement attachment, of a first version of the invention, comprising
      a rigidly-mounted base frame <b>45</b> (also referred to as a first framework),
      and a slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b> (also referred to as a second framework).
      The rigidly-mounted base frame <b>45</b> is configured for connection to the
      bottom-link arms <b>318</b> and top-link arm <b>324</b> of mobile machinery,
      such as the tractor <b>38</b> (see <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 1<i>a</i></figref>).
      Connections from the tractor to the rigidly-mounted base frame <b>45</b> occur
      at the top link attachment <b>66</b> and at the two bottom-link attachment <b>68</b>.
      The rigidly-mounted base frame <b>45</b>, also referred to as the first frame,
      has at least two parallel, vertically spaced apart, laterally extending rails.
      In the version shown in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref
      idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 6</figref>, the first frame <b>45</b> comprises
      four tiered horizontal longitudinal frame member rails <b>48</b>, <b>49</b>,
      <b>50</b>, <b>51</b>, which can be solid or hollow and any suitable shape in
      cross-section, rigidly connected at the ends to at least two vertical support
      members, also referred to as studs, and capable of being removably secured to
      the three-point hitch of the tractor. Preferably in the design of the rigidly-mounted
      base frame there are at least two upper and two lower horizontal frame members
      providing an opening of sufficient size between the upper and lower horizontal
      frame members to accommodate a Power Take Off \u201CPTO\u201D driveline if required
      for the attached implement. The PTO opening arraignment is shown in <figref
      idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 7</figref> using a double driver configuration allowing
      for the space needed for the PTO driveline to connect to an implement. <figref
      idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
      6</figref> show three upper and three lower horizontal frame members for the
      rigidly-mounted base frame showing the rigidly-mounted base frame with six horizontal
      longitudinal aligned frame members, wherein frame member <b>47</b> (also referred
      to as upper cross beam), <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> are in an upper position and
      frame members <b>50</b>, <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> (member <b>52</b> is also referred
      to as lower cross beam), are in a lower positions, and four vertical frame members.
      Frame members <b>53</b> and <b>54</b>, also referred to as studs, are positioned
      to one side of the rigidly-mounted base frame and frame members <b>55</b> and
      <b>56</b> are positioned to the opposing side of the rigidly-mounted base frame.
      Members <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b>, and <b>56</b> are also referred to
      as studs. Members <b>48</b>, <b>49</b>, <b>50</b>, and <b>51</b> are also referred
      to as rails. The laterally adjustable three-point hitch implement attachment
      apparatus <b>40</b> has square shaped horizontal sliding-frame members <b>57</b>,<b>58</b>,<b>59</b>,<b>60</b>
      (also referred to as sleeves) and square shaped horizontal rigid-frame members
      <b>47</b>,<b>48</b>,<b>49</b>,<b>50</b>,<b>51</b>,<b>52</b> oriented in a diamond
      shape with all sides placed at forty-five degree angles as compared to a horizontal
      plane. By square shaped this is with regard to a vertical cross section and
      preferably they are oriented with a corner facing upwardly.<br />[0304] The
      slidable-mounted frame <b>46</b> comprises at least two horizontal longitudinally
      aligned hollow frame member tubes securely and sturdily connected at the ends
      with at least two vertical frame members forming a generally rectangular sturdy
      frame that is transversely and slidably-mounted on at least two horizontal longitudinal
      frame members, bars or rails of the rigidly-mounted base frame <b>45</b> enabling
      the slidable-mounted frame <b>46</b> to travel transversely, also referred to
      as laterally, across from one side to the other side of the rigidly-mounted
      base frame <b>45</b>. <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 5</figref> shows two
      upper and two lower horizontal hollow frame members for the slidably-mounted
      frame, wherein frame members <b>57</b> and <b>58</b> are in the upper positions
      and frame members <b>59</b> and <b>60</b> are in the lower positions. They slide
      on the rails of the base frame <b>45</b>. Shown in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
      5</figref> are four vertical frame members, two vertical frame members <b>61</b>
      and <b>62</b> are positioned to one side and frame members <b>63</b> and <b>64</b>
      are positioned to the opposing side. Frame members <b>61</b>-<b>64</b> are also
      referred to as posts. Four hollow horizontal slidable-mounted frame members
      as opposed to two hollow horizontal slidable-mounted frame members can provide
      a greater load carrying capacity of the connecting apparatus.<br />[0305] The
      upper horizontal rigidly-mounted base frame members <b>48</b> and <b>49</b>
      pass thru the upper slidable-mounted frame members <b>57</b> and <b>58</b>.
      The lower horizontal rigidly-mounted base frame members <b>50</b> and <b>51</b>
      pass thru the lower slidable-mounted frame members <b>59</b> and <b>60</b>.
      The slidable-mounted frame <b>46</b> is free to laterally move with respect
      to the rigidly-mounted base frame <b>45</b>. All six rigidly-mounted base frame
      members and all four slidable-mounted frame members are typically vertically
      coplanar. While <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 5</figref> and subsequent
      figures show a frame made from longitudinal members having a rectangular or
      square cross-section, it is contemplated that longitudinal members may be formed
      having a cylindrical cross-sectional area such as pipes or solid rods (see <figref
      idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 39<i>b</i></figref>). <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
      5</figref> and subsequent figures show the square frame members turned in a
      diagonal horizontal position representing a diamond shape, the connecting apparatus
      would also work in a similar fashion with the frame members turned in the square
      position with the bottom and top of the frame members situated in a horizontal
      squared position (see <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 39<i>a</i></figref>)
      as opposed to a forty-five degree diamond slanted position when compared to
      a horizontal plane.<br />[0306] As depicted in subsequent drawings, (see <figref
      idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIGS. 13, 14, 15, 16</figref>) a lighter more economical
      version of the connecting apparatus <b>40</b> as depicted in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
      5</figref> can be configured with only two hollow horizontal frame members included
      in the slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b> and only four horizontal frame members
      included in the rigidly-mounted base frame <b>45</b>. (see <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIGS.
      13, 14, 15, 16</figref>) In addition to the connecting apparatus as depicted
      in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 5</figref>, a larger stronger version
      of the connecting apparatus can be configured by increasing the number of horizontal
      frame members included in the slidably-mounted frame to six or more (not shown)
      and increasing number of horizontal frame members in the rigidly-mounted frame
      to eight or more. (not shown) Also in addition to adding horizontal and vertical
      frame members to gain more strength and weight carrying capacity of the connecting
      apparatus, using a stronger or greater diameter and thickness of the metal used
      in all of the frame members will achieve a greater weigh carrying and working
      capacity. For great weight carrying and working capacity of the connecting apparatus,
      all of the rigidly-mounted base frame horizontal frame members can be constructed
      of solid steel bars.<br />[0307] <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 6</figref>
      shows a single location of top-link attachment plate <b>66</b> and two locations
      of bottom-link attachment plates <b>68</b> located on the rigidly-mounted frame
      <b>45</b>, which are for attachment to the tractor top-link and bottom-link
      points, respectively, of the three-point hitch. Four horizontal sliding-frame
      members or sleeves are shown. Pushing or pulling means such as a hydraulic actuator
      and cylinder, electric actuator and cylinder, pneumatic actuator and cylinder,
      other positioning devices, chain, cable, belt or combinations thereof are provided
      for moving the slidable-mounted frame <b>46</b> laterally and parallel to the
      rigidly-mounted frame <b>45</b>.<br />[0308] For example, a single hydraulic
      driver <b>80</b> is mounted for the lateral adjustments of the sliding-frame
      <b>46</b>. The hydraulic driver <b>80</b> provides lateral movement of the slidably-mounted
      frame <b>46</b> across the rigidly-mounted base frame <b>45</b>. The slidably-mounted
      frame <b>46</b> is free to slide laterally with respect to the base frame <b>45</b>.
      The left-right movement and position of slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b> is
      changed by at least one hydraulic driver <b>80</b> comprising a housing <b>82</b>
      and a piston <b>83</b>, or optionally more than one driver, such as two hydraulic
      drivers <b>80</b> (see <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 7</figref>). Typically,
      the driver has an internal stop for limiting the lateral movement of the slidably-mounted
      frame <b>46</b>. The hydraulic driver is connected between the rigidly-mounted
      base frame <b>45</b> and the slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b>. The cylinder
      housing <b>82</b> of the hydraulic driver <b>80</b> is removably attached at
      one end to a bracket <b>90</b> with a pin and clip and the bracket <b>90</b>
      is connected to bracket <b>92</b><i>b </i>which is connected to the rigidly-mounted
      base frame <b>45</b> at vertical frame member <b>56</b>. The piston <b>83</b>
      of the hydraulic driver <b>80</b> is removably attached to a bracket <b>89</b>
      with a pin and clip and the bracket <b>89</b> is connected to a bracket <b>94</b><i>b
      </i>which is connected to the slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b> at the vertical
      frame member <b>61</b>. In this configuration, when the piston <b>83</b> of
      the hydraulic driver <b>80</b> moves out of the housing <b>82</b>, the slidably-mounted
      frame <b>46</b> is caused to slide away from the bracket <b>90</b> of the rigidly-mounted
      base frame <b>45</b>. When the piston <b>83</b> of the hydraulic driver <b>80</b>
      moves back into housing <b>82</b>, the slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b> is caused
      to move closer to the bracket <b>90</b> of the rigidly-mounted base frame <b>45</b>.
      The hydraulic cylinder housing <b>82</b> has two hydraulic flexible lines <b>85</b>
      attached which in turn can be attached to a tractor manual hydraulic control
      valve <b>236</b> and the automated hydraulic control valve <b>238</b>. The driver
      <b>80</b> can be operated manually or automatically.<br />[0309] The single
      hydraulic cylinder <b>80</b> is mounted in a centered location between the top
      and bottom of the sliding-frame <b>46</b> for lateral adjustment of the sliding-frame
      <b>46</b>. The single hydraulic cylinder centered design can be used when a
      Power Take Off \u201CPTO\u201D driveline is not required for the implement that
      is attached to the connection apparatus as this centered single hydraulic cylinder
      position would obstruct the pathway <b>98</b> of a PTO driveline (see <figref
      idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 7</figref>) as it is connected between the tractor
      PTO shaft and the implement to be attached to the connection apparatus.<br />[0310]
      The driver typically has static loading capacity, meaning that when the driver
      stops and reaches a predetermined adjustment point, the driver essentially locks
      in place and can support a load that is either pulling or pushing on the driver.
      Typically, in an agricultural tractor application, the tractor hydraulic system
      control valves and hydraulic cylinders are valved for a static loading capacity.
      Typical electric linear actuators that are screw or gear driven generally have
      a static loading capacity or an electro-mechanical brake added to provide improved
      static loading capacity.<br />[0311] Preferably hydraulic drivers are used as
      compared to electric, sprocket and chain drives, pneumatic drives and electro-magnetic
      drives. Hydraulic actuators are rugged and suited for high-force applications.
      They can produce forces 25 times greater than pneumatic cylinders of equal size.
      They also operate in pressures of up to 4,000 psi.<br />[0312] Electric motor
      actuator drives are weak and usually expensive compared to hydraulic cylinder
      movement applications. Electrical actuators can be used, because they have fewer
      component parts and can provide precision-control positioning. An example of
      the range of accuracy is +/\u22120.0003 in. and a repeatability of less than
      0.00004 in. Their setups are scalable for any purpose or force requirement,
      and are quiet, smooth, and repeatable. The initial unit cost of an electrical
      actuator is higher than that of pneumatic and hydraulic actuators.<br />[0313]
      Sprocket and chain drives can be used, but they have slack between the parts
      causing less precise movement when compared to a hydraulic cylinder positioning
      system.<br />[0314] Pneumatic cylinder drives can be used but they have limited
      position control Electro-magnetic actuators such as linear motor actuators,
      although possible in this application, generally do not possess sufficient force
      capacity for linear movement. Linear motor actuators do have the advantage of
      being able to be sealed very easily against moisture and corrosion allowing
      for a long service life. As technology advances, electro-magnetic actuators
      may be a preferred choice in many applications. Mechanical actuator means only
      of controlling the driver may be useful in a limited number of applications
      using mobile machinery.<br />[0315] Manual operational control of the hydraulic
      or electric driver can be preferred in some applications while using the connecting
      apparatus. A switch switching between manual and automatic control of the driver
      can be provided along with a manual control valve or switch. One instance when
      manual control of the driver may be utilized is when then mobile machine operator
      is attaching or removing implements from the connecting apparatus. The manually
      operated valve or switch would provide manual lateral positioning of the connecting
      apparatus slidable frame for hookup of an implement. Another instance where
      manual operation of the driver may be utilized is when the mobile machine operator
      has no automatic guidance system setup for use or the mobile machine operator
      simply prefers the manual operation of the driver in certain applications.<br

      grease fittings <b>74</b> for each horizontal frame member of the slidable-mounted
      frame <b>46</b> are provided to lubricate the sliding action of the slidable-mounted
      frame <b>46</b> upon the rigidly mounted frame <b>45</b>. Optimally, sixteen

      </i>is connected from the data entry monitor <b>150</b><i>b </i>to the controller
      <b>150</b>. (see <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>) The
      controller <b>150</b> sends a signal <b>150</b><i>a </i>to the automatic hydraulic
      control valve <b>238</b>. (see <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>)
      In the instance where an electric actuator is used for the driver <b>80</b>,
      <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 4<i>b </i></figref>shows the configuration
      of the electrical components for the operation of the driver <b>80</b>.<br />[0322]
      <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 7</figref> shows a double hydraulic cylinder
      providing lateral movement of the slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b> across the
      rigidly-mounted base frame <b>45</b>. The double hydraulic cylinder design can
      be used when a Power Take Off (\u201CPTO\u201D) driveline is required for the
      implement that is attached to the connection apparatus, as this double hydraulic
      cylinder design normally does not obstruct the pathway of a PTO driveline as
      it is connected between the tractor PTO shaft and the implement to be attached
      to the connection apparatus. In addition, heavy loads that may be mounted on
      the connection apparatus can benefit from the double hydraulic cylinder design
      by spreading out the push-pull force of the hydraulic cylinders to two locations
      of the sliding-frame <b>46</b> instead of one location. The slidably-mounted
      frame <b>46</b> is free to slide laterally with respect to the base frame <b>45</b>.<br
      />[0323] The left-right movement and position of slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b>
      is controlled by two hydraulic drivers <b>80</b>. Each hydraulic driver is connected
      between the rigidly-mounted base frame <b>45</b> and the second slidably-mounted
      frame <b>46</b>. The housing <b>82</b> (see <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
      6</figref>) of the top hydraulic cylinder <b>80</b> is connected at one end
      to the bracket <b>90</b> which is connected to brackets <b>92</b><i>a </i>which
      are connected to the rigidly-mounted base frame <b>45</b> at vertical frame
      member <b>56</b>. The piston <b>83</b> of the top hydraulic driver <b>80</b>
      is connected at one end to the bracket <b>89</b> which is connected to bracket
      <b>94</b><i>a </i>which is connected to the slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b>
      at vertical frame member <b>61</b>. The housing <b>82</b> of the bottom hydraulic
      driver <b>80</b> is connected at one end to the bracket <b>90</b> which is connected
      to bracket <b>92</b><i>c </i>which is connected to the rigidly-mounted base
      frame <b>45</b> at vertical frame member <b>56</b>. The piston <b>83</b> of
      the bottom hydraulic driver <b>80</b> is connected at one end to the bracket
      <b>89</b> which is connected to bracket <b>94</b><i>c </i>which is connected
      to the slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b> at vertical frame member <b>61</b>.
      In this double hydraulic driver configuration, when the pistons <b>83</b> of
      the hydraulic drivers <b>80</b> moves out of hydraulic housing, the slidably-mounted
      frame <b>46</b> is caused to slide away from the bracket <b>90</b> of the base
      frame <b>45</b>. When the pistons <b>83</b> of the hydraulic driver <b>80</b>
      moves back into the housings <b>82</b>, slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b> is
      caused to move closer to brackets <b>90</b> of the base frame <b>45</b>. In
      the double hydraulic cylinder configuration, the hydraulic fluid flow divider
      <b>88</b> is utilized to provide even distribution of hydraulic fluid to each
      hydraulic driver <b>80</b>, causing both hydraulic drivers <b>80</b> to be synchronized
      with each other while moving in parallel to provide the lateral movement of
      the slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b> with respect to the rigidly-mounted base
      frame <b>45</b>. Hydraulic lines <b>86</b> are disposed between each hydraulic
      cylinder <b>80</b> and the hydraulic fluid flow divider <b>88</b> for even fluid
      distribution to the hydraulic cylinders <b>80</b> while hydraulic lines <b>87</b>
      are disposed between the hydraulic fluid flow divider <b>88</b> and the hydraulic
      control valve normally equipped on a tractor carrying the connecting apparatus.
      The double hydraulic cylinder configuration can be helpful in moving the slidably-mounted
      frame <b>46</b> when the implement to be carried by the connecting apparatus
      is of the larger and heavier nature.<br />[0324] With reference to <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIGS.

      and the top-bar first bar <b>100</b><i>a </i>have indicia markings, also referred
      to as positioning indicia, laid down in inches or millimeters thereon, to provide
      useful adjustment marks. Laser receiver <b>110</b> has a left alignment indicator
      <b>110</b><i>a, </i>center alignment indicator <b>110</b><i>b </i>and a right
      alignment indicator <b>110</b><i>c. </i>The top-bar first bar <b>100</b><i>a
      </i>extends laterally beyond the slidable frame <b>46</b> as is needed. A position-sensor
      <b>151</b> is attached to the-top-bar mounting leg <b>101</b>. A position-sensor
      bar <b>151</b><i>a </i>is attached to the rigid-frame horizontal frame member

      is a perspective view of the implement-facing side of the connecting apparatus
      <b>40</b>. The slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b> provides connection means for
      most three-point hitch implements in the agricultural and earth excavating fields,
      such as bed shapers, seed planters, plant transplanters, cultivators, weeders,
      sprayers, rippers, box scrapers and the like. The slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b>
      is fitted with two double-frame member wrap around bracket clamps <b>78</b>,
      which are mounted to the slidably-mounted horizontal frame sleeves <b>59</b>
      and <b>60</b>. Sliding-frame bottom-link mounting arms <b>132</b> attach to
      two double wrap-around bracket clamps <b>78</b> which protrude out towards the
      implement to be attached. Sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch slip-on housing
      <b>135</b>, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,059,419, attach and secure over
      the sliding-frame bottom-link mounting arms <b>132</b>. (see <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
      23</figref>) The bottom-link attachment points are normally spaced between <b>20</b>
      and <b>36</b> inches apart in a centered location on the slidably-mounted frame
      <b>46</b> and located near the horizontal plane of sliding-frame member <b>60</b>.
      The slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b> is also fitted with a top-link quick hitch
      attachment point attached to the double wrap-around bracket clamp <b>78</b>
      which is mounted to slidably-mounted horizontal frame members <b>57</b> and
      <b>58</b>. The top-link quick hitch attachment point is normally horizontally
      centered between left and right on the slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b> and
      adjustably located near or between the horizontal planes of sliding-frame members
      <b>57</b> and <b>58</b>. The two sliding-frame bottom-link attachment hooks
      <b>136</b> and latching mechanism <b>139</b> combined with the sliding-frame
      top-link hook <b>130</b> provides for quick and easy attachment of a three-point
      hitch implement such as the carry-all <b>300</b> (see <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
      2</figref>) and serve as connectors.<br />[0327] The rigid-frame alignment marks
      <b>70</b> are located on the top rigid-frame horizontal frame member <b>47</b>
      marking the edge of the sliding-frame when the sliding-frame is centered on
      the rigid frame. The rigid-frame alignment mark <b>72</b> located on the top
      rigid-frame horizontal frame member <b>47</b> marks the center of the sliding-frame
      when the sliding-frame is centered on the rigid frame. Rigid-frame alignment
      marks <b>70</b> located on the bottom rigid-frame horizontal frame member <b>52</b>
      mark the edge of the sliding-frame when the sliding-frame is centered on the
      rigid frame. The rigid-frame alignment mark <b>72</b> located on the bottom
      rigid-frame horizontal frame member <b>52</b> marks the center of the sliding-frame
      when the sliding-frame is centered on the rigid frame.<br />[0328] With reference
      to <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIGS. 14 and 23</figref>, there is shown the
      sliding-frame bottom-link mounting arms <b>132</b> and rotatable ball joints
      <b>134</b> that are normally located on the end of a tractor's bottom-link arms
      <b>318</b>. (see <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 1<i>c</i></figref>) Serving
      as the bottom connector on the sliding frame is a quick-hitch slip on housing
      <b>135</b> as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,059,419. Connector <b>135</b> securely
      mounts over the sliding-frame bottom-link mounting arms <b>132</b>. The sliding-frame
      bottom-link quick hitch slip on housing <b>135</b> and latching mechanism <b>139</b>
      allow for a quick hookup and release of the implement from the tractor bottom-link
      arms. Direct hookup of sliding-frame bottom-link mounting arms <b>132</b> (see
      <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 14</figref>) to the implement is a more
      cumbersome hookup procedure as compared to the quick hitch style of implement
      hookup, although this direct sliding-frame bottom-link mounting arm <b>132</b>
      hookup may provide a more secure and tighter fit to the implement in very precise
      method of use applications. The quick hitch slip on housing <b>135</b>, U.S.
      Pat. No. 7,059,419 includes a hook means <b>136</b> open at the top and a manually
      or spring operated latch <b>139</b> as shown in a close up view (see <figref
      idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 23</figref>). This close-up view shows the slip
      on housing slips over the sliding-frame bottom-link mounting arm <b>132</b>
      and is then held in place by a pin which enters the slip on housing <b>135</b>
      and then extends through the rotatable socket and ball with axial hole of arm
      <b>132</b>. Additional securing and adjustment screws are located around the
      slip on housing <b>135</b> for fine adjustments and a tight level fit.<br />[0329]
      With reference to <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 8</figref>, the top-link
      quick hitch attachment comprises a top-link channel back spacer <b>119</b> to
      vertically align the top-link quick hitch attachment points with the sliding-frame
      bottom-link quick hitch attachment points <b>136</b>. An additional top-link
      bracket spacer <b>121</b> is attached between the double wrap around bracket
      clamp <b>78</b> and the top-link channel back spacer <b>119</b> to provide access
      to the double wrap-around bracket clamp <b>78</b> mounting bolts. Attached to
      the top-link channel back spacer <b>119</b> is an adjustable mounting channel
      <b>122</b>. Bolted into the adjustable mounting channel <b>122</b> is a sliding-frame
      top-link hook and stop bar <b>130</b> top-link channel side spacers <b>120</b>
      inserted and bolted through. The sliding-frame top-link hook <b>130</b> generally
      is deeper and longer than the sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch hook and
      stop bar <b>136</b>, the sliding-frame top-link hook <b>130</b> does not generally
      perform lifting functions of the attached implements, the sliding-frame top-link
      hook <b>130</b> hooks under and then up to catch the top-link hookup connection
      on the implement <b>312</b> (see <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 2</figref>)
      and holds the implement in place and allows the adjustment of tilting forward
      and backwards performed by the tractor mounted top-link arm <b>324</b>. (see
      <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 1<i>c</i></figref>) Top-link arm <b>324</b>
      is mounted to the tractor at location <b>340</b> (see <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.
      3</figref>) and to the connecting apparatus, and in many applications can be
      a double action hydraulic cylinder performing tilting adjustments for the attached
      implement.<br />[0330] <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 9</figref> is a perspective
      view of the implement facing side of the connecting apparatus, showing the sliding-frame
      bottom-link housing <b>138</b> attached to the adjustable mounting channel <b>122</b>
      which traverses the four horizontal frame members <b>57</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>59</b>,
      <b>60</b> of the sliding-frame <b>46</b>. The adjustable mounting channel <b>122</b>
      attaches to two double wrap-around bracket clamps <b>78</b> of the sliding-frame
      <b>46</b>. The adjustable mounting channel <b>122</b> in this configuration
      can provide additional bottom-link higher or lower adjustments and added strength
      to the sliding-frame <b>46</b> while allowing space for an implement PTO driveline
      to pass through the connecting apparatus from the implement being carried to
      the tractor PTO shaft. A sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch bolt-on housing
      <b>138</b> can be provided in place of the sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch
      slip-on housing <b>135</b>, U.S. Pat. No. 7,059,419. The sliding-frame bottom-link
      quick-hitch bolt-on housing <b>138</b> can be a more stable attachment for the
      bottom-link connection point to the implement of the connecting apparatus as
      compared to the sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch slip-on housing <b>135</b>.
      In the alternative for connecting an implement to the connecting apparatus,
      the sliding-frame bottom-link mounting arm and ball socket, bolt-on <b>133</b>,
      as shown in <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 20</figref>, can be used in
      place of the sliding-frame bottom-link quick-hitch bolt-on housing <b>138</b>
      to provide a more stable attachment of the implement to the connecting apparatus.
      The position-sensor <b>151</b> sliding-frame mounted is attached to a top-bar
      mounting leg <b>101</b>.<br />[0331] The position-sensor bar <b>151</b><i>a
      </i>is rigid-frame mounted, and is attached to the top rigid-frame horizontal
      frame member <b>47</b> with position-sensor bar attachment brackets <b>152</b>.
      Position sensor electrical wires <b>152</b><i>b </i>and the position sensor
      bar electrical wires <b>152</b><i>a </i>extend from both position sensor <b>151</b>
      and position sensor bar <b>151</b><i>a </i>to provide the conductors for the
      position sensor signal <b>151</b><i>b </i>and the position sensor bar signal
      <b>151</b><i>c. </i>Optionally a wireless connection can be used. The position
      sensor <b>151</b> and the position sensor bar <b>151</b><i>a </i>can send a
      visual screen signal <b>153</b><i>e </i>for an operator's viewable positioning
      screen <b>153</b><i>d </i>for the tractor operator to view the position of the
      slidable-frame <b>46</b> position as related to the rigid-frame <b>45</b> position
      while looking forward and away from the rear three-point hitch mounted connecting
      apparatus. This allows the tractor operator to reposition the rigid-frame <b>45</b>
      by repositioning the tractor using the tractors steering if the tractor is diverging
      from the prescribed path. Auto-steering of the tractor can also be utilized
      by configuring the position sensor <b>151</b> and the position sensor bar <b>151</b><i>a
      </i>with an automated auto-steer controller <b>153</b> utilizing an auto-steer
      controller signal <b>153</b><i>a </i>sent to the auto-steer device <b>153</b><i>b
      </i>to control the steering of the tractor. The auto-steer controller can be
      equipped with an auto-steer controller on-off switch <b>153</b><i>c </i>to allow
      the tractor operator to manually steer the tractor when necessary.<br />[0332]
      In the instance the auto-steer function is utilized, and in the instance the
      tractor is to be steered in a straight line only by the auto-steer function,
      mounting the connecting apparatus on the rear three-point hitch of a front wheel
      steered tractor is sufficient to keep the tractor in a straight line. In the
      instance a front wheel steered tractor is required to auto-steer in a path that
      is not a straight line such as turns, the connecting apparatus <b>40</b> can
      be mounted on the front of the tractor for precise steering along a predetermined
      path. In this instance the present apparatus <b>40</b> can be mounted on the
      front three-point hitch of the tractor and another apparatus <b>40</b> can be
      mounted on the rear three-point hitch of the tractor depending on the application
      and implements being used. In the alternative to mounting the apparatus <b>40</b>
      on the front of a front wheel steered tractor in a situation where the predetermined
      path follows turns and the apparatus <b>40</b> is required to be mounted on
      the rear three-point hitch of the tractor, a separate auto steer device can
      be mounted on the front of the tractor to achieve sufficient auto-steering results
      in a predetermined path following turns.<br />[0333] Optionally for mobile machinery
      equipped with an auto-steering system <b>153</b> and <b>153</b><i>b, </i>such
      as those provided by Trimble of Sunnyvale, Calif., the position sensor <b>151</b>
      sensing the position of the second framework relative to the first framework,
      can use the auto-steer system for automatically adjusting the position of the
      mobile machinery based on the sensed position of the second framework relative
      to the first framework. Current auto-steering devices work by either controlling
      the hydraulic fluid of the mobile machinery hydraulic steering system or controlling
      the mechanical steering wheel of the mobile machinery.<br />[0334] <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG.

      apparatus <b>40</b>, showing the adjustable mounting channel <b>122</b> attached
      to the double wrap around bracket clamp <b>78</b> comprising a two horizontal
      frame member channel mounting configuration of the sliding-frame for the bottom-link
      connections to the implement. This configuration expands the pathway <b>98</b>
      for a PTO driveline as compared to <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 9</figref>.
      Grease fittings, also referred to as great joints <b>74</b>, are shown. Two
      viewable gauges level measurement <b>146</b> are secured to a gauge mounting
      plate <b>145</b> mounted on the top and at each end of the rigid-frame top horizontal
      frame member <b>47</b>, and situated to be viewed from the rear of the tractor
      such as from the tractor seat area allowing the tractor operator to view and
      adjust the connecting apparatus accordingly. Two viewable gauges plumb measurement
      <b>147</b> are mounted on the side, near the top of each rigid-frame vertical
      frame member <b>53</b> and <b>56</b>. One auto-sensor gauge level measurement
      <b>148</b> is mounted on one of the gauge mounting plates <b>145</b> situated
      on the rigid-frame horizontal frame member <b>47</b>. One auto-sensor gauge
      plumb measurement <b>149</b> is mounted on the side, near the top of rigid-frame
      vertical frame member <b>53</b>. The auto-sensor devices can automate the level
      and plumb positions of the connecting apparatus utilizing the tractor installed
      hydraulic positioning of the tractors three-point hitch. This automated leveling
      and plumbing of the connecting apparatus requires the tractor three-point hitch
      to accommodate controlled hydraulic cylinders at the top-link arm <b>324</b>
      and on at least one of the bottom-link arms <b>318</b>.<br />[0335] A bottom-bar
      <b>140</b> is mounted on the bottom of the slidable-mounted frame <b>46</b>
      and below the sliding-frame bottom-link <b>138</b>, and below a double wrap-around
      bracket clamp <b>78</b> being securely fastened to the slidable-mounted frame
      <b>46</b> with bottom-bar mounting legs <b>142</b>. Bottom-bar sensor or cameras
      <b>144</b> are securely mounted to the underside of the bottom-bar <b>140</b>,
      in the case of sensors, for the detection of electronic signals transmitted
      from an underground buried cable in which the slidable-mounted frame <b>46</b>
      adjusts laterally to follow the path of the signal transmitted from the underground
      buried cable. In the case of cameras, recognition computer software can be used
      to detect the position of crops or other items like line markers or shapes to
      adjust the slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b> in position. Bottom-bar signal wire
      <b>144</b><i>a </i>can transmit the signal to controller <b>150</b> (see <figref

      base frame <b>45</b> and their own slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b>. All three
      slidably-mounted frames <b>46</b> move independently of each other. The wing
      sections <b>221</b> can be utilized for carrying lighter duty implements such
      as weeders, sprayers, cutters and the like. The wing sections <b>221</b> attach
      to the three-point attached first connecting apparatus <b>40</b> using a hinge.
      A piano style hinge <b>230</b> can be a suitable preferred attachment device
      to utilize for the attachment and pivoting action of the wing section <b>221</b>
      as connected to the three-point attached first connecting apparatus <b>40</b>
      left and right side edges. Attachment hardware <b>224</b> and <b>226</b> allows

      on the first connecting apparatus <b>40</b> and on each wing section <b>221</b>
      at the joining corners at the top and bottom of the three rigidly mounted frame
      sections <b>45</b>. Each wing section <b>221</b> pivoting action can be controlled
      separately apart from the opposing wing section allowing for individual control
      of the wing sections. Two hydraulic cylinders <b>228</b> for each wing section
      <b>221</b> can work in tandem using a hydraulic fluid flow divider <b>232</b>
      between the hydraulic cylinders <b>228</b> and the tractor mounted hydraulic
      control valve <b>234</b>. For control of the slidably mounted frames <b>46</b>
      on each wing sections <b>221</b>, the wing section driver <b>80</b> can attach
      directly between the rigidly mounted first frame <b>45</b> and the slidably

      <b>80</b> piston arm and the attachment bracket <b>90</b> to the driver <b>80</b>
      cylinder housing. The mounted position of the driver <b>80</b> on the wing section
      differs from the mounting position of the driver <b>80</b> on the first connecting
      apparatus <b>40</b>. This difference is the result of the offset positioning
      of the wing section <b>221</b> slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b> as mounted on
      the rigidly mounted first frame <b>45</b>.<br />[0371] Shown are hydraulic fluid

      such as a hydraulic or electrically powered cylinder, or for locally pumped
      fluid, a power receptacle can be provided on the first framework <b>45</b> of
      the first connecting apparatus <b>40</b>, or alternatively on the mobile machinery.
      The power receptacle can receive hydraulic fluid or electrical power such as
      DC or AC power. For hydraulic or electrically powered devices for driving the
      second framework of the first connecting apparatus <b>40</b>, such as a hydraulic
      or electrically powered cylinder, or for locally pumped fluid, a power receptacle
      can be provided on the mobile machinery. The power receptacle can receive power
      such as hydraulic fluid or DC or AC power.<br />[0373] Each wing section <b>221</b>
      slidably-mounted frame <b>46</b> is mounted in an offset position on the wing
      section rigidly-mounted base frame <b>45</b> to allow for the implements attached
      to the wing section <b>221</b> to extend past the outer edge of the wing section
      <b>221</b>, thereby allowing for the implements attached to the first connecting
      apparatus <b>40</b> to extend partially across and into the horizontal plane
      of the wing section <b>221</b>. This allows for a cultivating or other farm
      work path of approximately sixty feet in width when utilizing three independently
      moving twenty feet wide implements. The outer wing section <b>221</b> sliding
      frames <b>46</b> move independently of each other and independently of the first
      connecting apparatus <b>40</b> sliding frame <b>46</b>. This independent motion
      of the sliding frames allows for a farmer to till, bed-shape and plant crop
      sections of the farmland in twenty-foot wide sections using the first connecting
      apparatus <b>40</b> with attached implements and then mount the lighter weight
      wing sections <b>221</b> to the first connecting apparatus <b>40</b> for the
      use of lighter weight implements that can traverse two additional twenty-feet
      wide crop sections for less strenuous implement activities such as weeding,
      spraying and harvesting. The independent motion of the wing section <b>221</b>
      sliding frames <b>46</b> allows the wing section <b>221</b> sliding frame <b>46</b>
      to follow their own particular section of the crop rows as that particular section
      of crop rows was planted by a guidance system independently of the other crop
      row sections in the sixty-foot total area covered, variances between the twenty-foot
      sections of crops rows throughout the farm occur. Conversely, if a sixty-foot
      continuous implement is attached to the first connecting apparatus <b>40</b>
      sliding-frame <b>46</b> with no independently controlled wing sections attached
      and traversing three twenty foot sections of crop rows and the twenty-foot sections
      of crop rows as shaped and planted independently of each other as many farmers
      practice currently, the sixty-foot continuous implement may not align properly
      with all of the planted crop rows resulting in damaged crops in a farming procedure
      such as weeding.<br />[0374] Functionality of the Related Parts of the Connecting
      Apparatus:<br />[0375] The receiver <b>110</b> or <b>110</b><i>e </i>provides
      the present position of the slidable-frame <b>46</b> to a GPS controller or
      laser beam fixedly located in the field. The GPS controller or laser beam contains
      the coordinates describing the desired field position of the implement attached
      to the slidable-frame <b>46</b> at any one time. If the slidable-frame <b>46</b>
      and the implement being carried are out of position, the GPS signal or laser
      beams signal, after being received by the receiver-<b>110</b> or <b>110</b><i>e,
      </i>directs the driver controller <b>150</b> to position the driver <b>80</b>
      to keep the implement which is attached to the connecting apparatus on the prescribed
      path using the hydraulic controls on the tractor the apparatus <b>40</b>. The
      piston of the hydraulic cylinder <b>80</b> moves the slidable-frame <b>46</b>
      laterally to the desired position as the tractor moves along.<br />[0376] A
      GPS controller is typically a microprocessor that receives GPS signals, compare
      the received signal to preprogrammed desired coordinates, and outputs a signal
      based on the difference, if any, between the desired coordinates and the received
      position. Such GPS controllers are conventionally used for controlling tractor
      steering. A conventional GPS guided steering system for tractors is available
      from Trimble of Sunnyvale, Calif. One popular GPS guidance system currently
      being used in the agricultural industry is called Real-Time Kinematic (RTK).
      RTK systems when combined with earth mounted base stations using radio or cellular
      signals relayed to the roving mobile machinery within a prescribed radius location
      can achieve horizontal accuracy of &lt;4 centimeters in most conditions. Laser
      guidance and wire signal guidance are also viable guidance system technologies
      available for the control of the present invention apparatuses. A laser guidance
      system normally uses a vertical spinning laser transmitter to be received by
      the laser receiver mounted on the apparatus top bar <b>100</b><i>a </i>or <b>100</b><i>b.
      </i>The laser receiver <b>110</b> then transmits a signal to the controller
      <b>150</b> which then controls the driver <b>80</b> and the position of the
      sliding frame <b>46</b> of the controlled apparatus <b>40</b>. A wire signal
      guidance system involves multiple sensors mounted on a bottom bar for a buried
      wire and on the top bar for overhead wires. The bottom bar <b>140</b> sensor
      mounted system normally is utilized in open field agriculture while the top
      bar <b>100</b><i>b </i>mounted sensors system normally is utilized in greenhouse
      agricultural applications.<br />[0377] The lateral position of the sliding frame
      with respect to the center line of the base frame and forward movement of the
      tractor can be adjusted by causing the pistons of the hydraulic cylinder <b>32</b>
      to extend or retract.<br />[0378] The control of the hydraulic cylinder <b>80</b>
      can be implemented in manual mode by the driver, a second individual, or automatically
      in automatic mode by a controller including sensors monitoring the position
      of the three-point hitch attached implement with respect to a known desired
      position for the implement.<br />[0379] A system according to this invention
      comprises the mobile machinery such as a tractor having a three-point hitch,
      the connecting apparatus attached to the mobile machinery with the three attachments;
      and an implement attached to the slidable second framework with at least three
      connectors. To connect the apparatus to the implement, the implement and apparatus
      are placed proximate to each other; the alignment of the connectors and the
      hitches are determined, and the alignment is adjusted by sliding the second
      framework relative to the first framework.<br />[0380] After attachment of the
      implement to the connecting apparatus is completed, during use of the system,
      the position of the implement relative to the mobile machinery is adjusted by
      the mobile machinery operator in manual mode or by the signal receiver <b>110</b>
      or <b>110</b><i>e </i>and the driver controller <b>150</b> in automatic mode,
      changing the position of the second framework to keep the implement on track.<br
      />[0381] The driver <b>80</b> can be powered hydraulically or electrically.

      a hydraulic driver and related components suitable for use with the present
      invention. It utilizes mobile machinery hydraulic pump <b>81</b>, which is normally
      used for controlling the three-point hitch link arms <b>318</b> and <b>324</b>
      (see <figref idref=\\\"DRAWINGS\\\">FIG. 3</figref>) and utilizes a fluid reservoir.
      A guidance signal is received by the receiver <b>110</b> or <b>110</b><i>e </i>which
      is connected to the driver controller <b>150</b>. The antenna (not shown) is
      optionally provided to enhance the reception of the guidance signal to the GPS
      receiver <b>110</b><i>e, </i>but not requires for a laser receiver <b>110</b>.
      The driver controller <b>150</b> transmits a signal to the automatic double
      action hydraulic valve <b>238</b> to control the driver <b>80</b>. If the hydraulic
      valve option switch <b>240</b> is in the automatic position, the automatic double
      action hydraulic valve <b>238</b> controls the driver <b>80</b>. If the hydraulic
      valve option switch <b>240</b> is in the manual position, the automatic double
      action hydraulic valve <b>238</b> does not receive hydraulic fluid and is not
      operational, and thus the manual double action hydraulic valve <b>236</b> controls
      the driver at the tractor operator's initiation. Hydraulic power receptacles
      <b>242</b> provide connect and disconnect locations for the hydraulic lines
      leading from the hydraulic fluid valves to the driver <b>80</b> for connection
      and removal of the apparatus from the three point hitch of the mobile machinery.<br

      method of using the invention for agricultural comprises:<br />[0385] 1. Choose
      a guidance system: [0386] a. Manual or automatic. [0387] b. If manual, choose

      />[0002] Mobile machinery such as agricultural tractors, bulldozers, track tractors,
      skip loaders, all-terrain vehicles and earth grading tractors, generally referred
      to as a \u201Ctractor,\u201D typically are provided with a suitable power plant,
      a source of fluid under pressure and or a source of electric current. The fluid
      pressure source includes suitable valve control means. The tractors typically
      include an implement mounting system known as a three-point hitch. The three-point
      hitch includes a pair of opposed spaced apart lateral bottom-link arms located
      at the rear of the tractor body or frame rotatably connected to the tractor
      with ball joints which are affixed to the frame or body of the tractor at a
      selected distance of typically 12 to 30 inches above the ground and extend on
      each side of a center draw bar. The free distal ends of the arms typically include
      a ball rotatable in a socket with an axial hole extending there through.<br
      />[0003] A third arm, called a top-link arm, is also rotatably connected with
      a ball joint to the tractor frame at a point about 30 to 60 inches above ground
      and centered above the bottom-link arms. The free distal end of the top-link
      arm is fitted with a rotatable ball with an axial hole extending there through
      for connecting to a center point on an implement in alignment with studs. Free
      ends of the two bottom-link arms and the top-link arm provide three-points of
      attachment to implements and therefore is referred to as a three-point hitch.
      The length of top-link arm is generally adjustable by means of a built in turn-buckle
      assembly. This provides for manual leveling of the attached implement. The top-link
      arm turn buckle assembly can be replaced with a hydraulic cylinder for quick
      controlled manual or automated adjustments of the length of the top-link arm
      resulting in adjustments of the attached three-point implement.<br />[0004]
      The bottom-link arms are connected to a lift-link arm to provide a means for
      lifting such as a suitable power lift mechanism, for example one or more hydraulic
      cylinders. This provides the capability to raise and lower the two bottom-link
      arms and thus the implement which is connected to the three-point hitch. Because
      the free ends of all three arms are connected to the tractor with ball joint
      type connections, all three arms may freely pivot to the left and the right
      any time the three-point hitch has the implement raised off the ground. On older
      tractors, an additional bar called a stabilizer arm is provided, if desired,
      and is connected to one of the first two bottom-link arms and to a fixed point
      on the tractor. On newer tractors, two stabilizer arms are provided, one for
      each bottom-link arm and they are also connected to a fixed point on the tractor.
      The stabilizer arms allow the bottom-link arms to still be raised and lowered
      by hydraulic means, but the implement is held stable with reference to the horizontal
      plane, and cannot swing to and fro as before.<br />[0005] The attached implement
      can include a transversely extending tool bar or frame member having laterally
      spaced apart studs extending from the front tractor-facing side of the implement
      for removable attachment to the sockets held within the distal ends of the bottom-link
      arms. In addition to the bottom-link arm attachment hardware means is an upper
      attachment hardware means for the attachment of the top-link arm.<br />[0006]
      A three-point hitch is standard equipment on most agricultural and earth grading
      tractors. The use of a three-point hitch provides lifting, lowering and tilting
      mechanisms to attached agricultural implements, such as agricultural implements.
      The tractor three-point hitch allows the attached tool or implement to be raised
      and lowered, tilted horizontally and tilted vertically, all such movements and
      adjustments provided by hydraulically activated cylinders or manual crank screw
      devices. Front three-point hitches, while available, are less common than rear
      three-point hitches on agricultural tractors.<br />[0007] The three-point hitch
      provides for a quick attachment of various implements needed on a tractor. In
      addition, when the implement is in the raised or lowered position, lateral movement
      of the three-point bottom-link arms is freely available. To limit lateral movement
      of the implement in the raised or lowered position, the user can add a stabilizer
      arm comprising a longitudinal member having a selected adjustable length attachable
      to a swing arm attachment point on the tractor body or frame with the opposing
      end attaching to the same implement stud as the adjacent swing arm to limit
      lateral movement of the bottom-link arms. Many tractor brands are now factory
      supplied with three-point hitch bottom-link stabilizer arms. Controlled lateral
      movement of an attached implement is not provided with a three-point hitch.<br
      />[0008] Earth-moving equipment in the construction and farming field has rapidly
      changed for the better in recent years with the introduction of Global Positioning
      Systems (GPS) and laser guidance systems. Current GPS guidance systems for earth-moving
      and agricultural tractors generally are designed to auto-steer the tractor.
      Much of the guidance involves steering the tractor in a straight line to form
      a straight road or straight row of crops. Since most agricultural and earth
      grading tractors are steered by the front end of the tractor, the rear end mounted
      three-point hitch attached implement may not align in a straight line with the
      front steered end of the tractor. This misalignment would normally occur while
      the tractor is turning 180 degrees around at the end of the crop row and then
      joining onto the next crop row in the other direction. This misalignment would
      also occur while the tractor is in the middle of the crop field and the tractor
      veered slightly off line of the crop straight line forcing the tractor operator
      to correct the steering of the tractor. This steering correction of the tractor
      can also shift the rear end of the tractor in the opposite direction of the
      steering correction causing the rear three-point connected implement to also
      veer off course of the straight crop row and possibly damage the crops while
      cultivating the field or misalign the crops while planting. Lasers have come
      into play in the earth-moving and agricultural field mostly by controlling grade
      leveling implements on the tractor in an up and down motion for achieving a
      level or sloped grade.<br />[0009] Conventional laterally moving implement toolbars
      pivot on four parallel supporting arms extending out from the front of the supporting
      frame. Short sized supporting arms provide limited lateral movement of the toolbar
      section of the implement. The short lateral movement is exacerbated by the positioning
      of the tool mounting bar being too close to the frame structure that mounts
      to the tractor three-point hitch. Mounting brackets further decrease the tool
      mounting bar clearance to the frame structure. Pivoting-support-arms pivot in
      either direction limiting the length of the lateral movement to much less than
      the length of the pivoting-support-arms. The weight that these pivoting-support-arms
      can support on the toolbar with heavy implements is dependent on the strength
      of the pivot arms and their pivot joints. The pivot joints need to sustain a
      tremendous weight load when handling a heavy implement as they pivot side to
      side. This weight load is compounded and increased if the pivoting-support-arms
      are increased in length.<br />[0010] Two-point hitch configurations present
      a different set of limitations for use of lateral connection devices. The three-point
      hitch invention differs from a two-point hitch in the mounting ability by utilizing
      the advantage of the top-link arm attachment to the tractor frame, the improved
      locations for the sleeves that provide the sliding housings, a more versatile
      and stable two tier stacked movable implement attachment section compared to
      the one movable toolbar and a more stable and functional two or more tiered
      stacked movable implement attachment section compared to the one movable implement
      attachment section.<br />[0011] Several patents teach methods of steering and
      controlling tractor mounted implement attachment systems to two-point and three-point
      hitch systems. U.S. Pat. No. 3,208,535 by Fischer teaches an automatic steering
      system for implements; U.S. Pat. No. 7,530,405 by Kollath et al. teaches a quick
      coupler mechanism, U.S. Pat. No. 4,019,753 by Kestel teaches an adjustable three-point
      tractor hitch; U.S. Pat. No. 4,463,811 by Winter teaches an implement with a
      laterally movable frame structure with limited lateral movement; and U.S. Pat.
      No. 5,931,234 by Trowbridge teaches a retractable three-point hitch mounted,
      vertically and laterally adjustable toolbar. U.S. Pat. No. 4,930,581 by Fleischer
      teaches a guidance control device for agricultural implements using a hydraulic
      cylinder to pivot the implement frame and implement to the left or to the right
      to correct lateral position with respect to the tractor and the previously processed
      rows. U.S. Pat. No. 3,208,535 by Fischer teaches an automatic steering device
      and a plant stem sensor.<br />[0012] Existing systems for pulling or pushing
      implements suffer from a significant disadvantage, particularly that the implement
      can go off course, particularly during turns. This can result in destroyed crops,
      inadequate application or over application of chemicals used for crops, unplowed
      soil, and other deleterious effects. These problems can occur even when the
      mobile machinery, such as a tractor, is on course.<br />[0013] Therefore, there
      is a need for a system that can allow an implement to be pushed or pulled that
      helps maintain the implement on track, even when the mobile machinery used for
      pulling or pushing the implement is off track.<br />SUMMARY<br />[0014] A system
      according to the present invention that satisfies this need includes a connecting
      apparatus suitable for connecting an implement to a three-point hitch of mobile
      machinery, such as a tractor. The connecting apparatus comprises a first framework
      disposed in a first plane and comprising at least two parallel, vertically spaced-apart,
      laterally extending rails. Three attachments are supported by the first framework
      for attachment to the three-point hitch. The slidable second framework is generally
      in the plane of the first framework and is mounted on the rails to slide laterally
      along the rails. At least two connectors, and typically three connectors, are
      supported by the slidable second framework for connecting the slidable second
      framework to an implement that can be pulled or pushed by the mobile machinery.
      At least one driver, and for a robust apparatus, two drivers, are connected
      to the first framework and connected to the second framework for driving the
      slidable framework laterally back and forth along the rails.<br />[0015] In
      use of the apparatus, the position of the implement relative to the mobile machinery
      is changed by the action of the driver, the driver laterally moving the second
      framework.<br />[0016] Typically, the first framework comprises an upper cross
      beam and a lower cross beam, each cross beam substantially parallel to the rails.
      In a preferred version the first framework comprises at least two rails, at
      least two vertically extending studs, the upper cross beam, and the lower cross
      beam. The upper cross beam can support one of the attachments and the lower
      cross beam can support two of the attachments, typically in a triangular configuration.<br
      />[0017] The driver can be at least one hydraulic cylinder or at least one electric
      linear actuator.<br />[0018] When a cylinder is used as part of the driver,
      the cylinder can be provided with a stop for limiting lateral movement of the
      second framework. The driver can be manually or automatically controlled. The
      manual control can be a lever or the like. Also a switch can be provided for
      switching between manual and automatic control.<br />[0019] Preferably there
      is a guidance system for automatically controlling the driver to position the
      slidable second framework in a predetermined pathway. The guidance system can
      comprise a GPS receiver, an underground (buried) or above ground guidance wire,
      or a position signal receiver for receiving a laser signal. The guidance system
      can comprise at least one GPS positioning receiver mounted on the second framework
      for receiving signals from the satellites or ground mounted base relay station
      to determine the position of the slidable second framework, and a controller
      for receiving position signals from the position signal receiver, the controller
      adapted to control the driver to position the slidable second framework in the
      predetermined pathway. The GPS guidance system utilizes data input into a data
      input monitor to set the predetermined coordinates of the mobile machinery and
      the connecting apparatus. GPS guidance can control the mobile machinery steering
      in addition to the connecting apparatus position. GPS positioning of the connecting
      apparatus in conjunction with GPS steering of the mobile machinery is an advantage
      over GPS steering of the mobile machinery alone while attempting to guide an
      attached implement along a predetermined pathway. In a guidance wire application,
      the guidance system can comprise at least one sensor mounted on the second framework
      for receiving signals from the guidance wire. The apparatus can comprise a position
      signal receiver supported by the slidable second framework for determining the
      position of the slidable second framework, and a controller for receiving position
      signals from the position signal receiver, the controller adapted to control
      the driver to position the slidable second framework in the predetermined pathway.
      The guidance system can comprise at least one laser position receiver for receiving
      a laser signal from a rotating vertical laser transmitter, and a controller
      for processing position signals from the position signal receiver, the controller
      adapted to control the driver to position the slidable second framework in the
      predetermined pathway. In a laser guidance application, generally there is no
      need for data entry into a data entry monitor. The position of the laser receiver
      on the connecting apparatus can position the connecting apparatus and steer
      the tractor if tractor steering is preferred.<br />[0020] The second framework
      can comprise at least one sleeve for sliding on at least one rail, and typically
      multiple sleeves for sliding on multiple rails.<br />[0021] To power the driver,
      the apparatus can include a power receptacle for receiving power from the mobile
      machinery, which can be electric power or hydraulic fluid power.<br />[0022]
      For implements that have more than three places for connection, there can be
      more than three connectors, such as four or more connectors.<br />[0023] To
      assist an operator of the mobile machinery, the apparatus can include a light
      fixture and at least one camera.<br />[0024] In a preferred version of the invention,
      for robustness, the first framework comprises four rails, and the second framework
      comprises four lateral substantially parallel sleeves connected at their ends
      by end posts, each sleeve slidable on one of the rails.<br />[0025] It is preferred
      that there be positioning indicia on the upper cross beam of the first framework
      for positioning the second framework relative to the first framework. This same
      type of positioning indicia can be used on the lower cross beam of the first
      framework. Also, there can be positioning indicia on one or more of the sleeves
      for adjusting the position of any connector supported by the sleeve.<br />[0026]
      Preferably the apparatus includes a sensor for sensing the position of the second
      framework relative to the first framework. This can be combined with an alert
      generator that generates an alert, such as a sound or flashing light, when the
      sensor senses that the second framework slides beyond a predetermined position.<br
      />[0027] Preferably the apparatus includes a plumb gauge and a level gauge for
      correctly adjusting the attitude and positioning of the implement.<br />[0028]
      Preferably at least one connector is laterally adjustable on the second framework.
      Also preferably at least one connector is vertically adjustable on the second
      framework.<br />[0029] Additionally, the apparatus can include a connection
      guidance system for connecting the apparatus to the implement, the connection
      guidance system comprising a sensor on at least one, and preferably at least
      two, connectors for sensing the position of the implement. With the connection
      guidance system, the system can include a method for connecting the apparatus
      to the implement, where the implement has hitches for connector with the connectors.
      The method comprises placing the implement and apparatus approximate to each
      other, determine the alignment of the connectors and the hitches, and adjusting
      the alignment by sliding the second framework relative to the first framework.<br
      />[0030] The invention also includes a system where the mobile machinery, the
      apparatus described above, and an implement are connected together, with the
      apparatus attached to the mobile machinery via the three-point hitch on the
      mobile machinery, and the implement attached to the slidable second framework
      with at least two connectors.<br />[0031] The system can also include a pair
      of support stands for supporting the apparatus when the apparatus is otherwise
      not well supported, such as not being attached to all three points of a three
      point hitch, each stand comprising pins for engaging corresponding holes in
      the vertical studs of the first framework. Clips can be used for holding the
      pins in their engagement position.<br />[0032] Multiple connection apparatus
      of the present invention can be daisy chained together such as having a central
      apparatus attached to the mobile machinery, and having an additional pair of
      the apparatus, each one of the pair pivotally and removably attached to the
      sides of the central apparatus. Each of the pair can be modified from the central
      apparatus such as for the driver location and driver connection between the
      first and second framework. Each of the outer pair is typically designed to
      carry lighter duty implements than the central apparatus.<br />[0033] A system
      according the present invention comprises: [0034] a) mobile machinery having
      a three-point hitch; [0035] b) the connection apparatus attached to the mobile
      machinery with the three attachments; and [0036] c) an implement attached to
      the slidable second framework with at least two connectors.<br />[0037] In a
      method of using the system there are the following steps: [0038] a) placing
      the implement and apparatus proximate to each other; [0039] b) determining the
      alignment of the connectors and the hitches; and [0040] c) adjusting the alignment
      by sliding the second framework relative to the first framework.<br />[0041]
      In a method for changing the position of an implement pulled or pushed by with
      mobile machinery, the mobile machinery having a three-point hitch, there are
      the steps of: [0042] a) attaching the connection apparatus to the three-point
      hitch of the mobile machinery with the three attachments; [0043] b) attaching
      the implement to the slidable second framework with the connectors; and [0044]
      c) changing the lateral position of the implement relative to the mobile machinery
      with the driver.<br />[0045] According to the invention, a method of attaching
      an implement to mobile machinery comprises the steps of: [0046] a) attaching
      the connecting apparatus to the mobile machinery with the attachments; [0047]
      b) aligning the connectors of the slidable second framework with the implement
      by moving the second framework relative to the first framework; and [0048] c)
      connecting the connectors to the implement.\",\"backgroundTextHtml\":\"CROSS-REFERENCE
